        description: "The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre was an incident on April 13, 1919, in which British troops fired on a large crowd of unarmed Indians in an open space known as the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar in the Punjab region (now in Punjab state) of India. The attack resulted in the deaths of several hundred people and the wounding of many hundreds more. The massacre marked a turning point in India’s modern history, as it left a permanent scar on Indo-British relations and was the prelude to Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s full commitment to the cause of Indian nationalism and independence from Britain.",

By the war’s end, expectations were high among the Indian populace that those measures would be eased and that India would be given more political autonomy. The Montagu-Chelmsford Report, presented to the British Parliament in 1918, did in fact recommend limited local self-government. Instead, however, the government of India passed what became known as the Rowlatt Acts in early 1919, which essentially extended the repressive wartime measures.",

Gandhi in early April called for a one-day general strike throughout the country. In Amritsar the news that prominent Indian leaders had been arrested and banished from that city sparked violent protests on April 10, in which soldiers fired upon civilians, buildings were looted and burned, and angry mobs killed several foreign nationals and severely beat a Christian missionary. A force of several dozen troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Reginald Edward Harry Dyer was given the task of restoring order. Among the measures taken was a ban on public gatherings.",

It is not clear how many people there were protesters who were defying the ban on public meetings and how many had come to the city from the surrounding region to celebrate Baisakhi, a spring festival. Dyer and his soldiers arrived and sealed off the exit. Without warning, the troops opened fire on the crowd, reportedly shooting hundreds of rounds until they ran out of ammunition. It is not certain how many died in the bloodbath, but, according to one official report, an estimated 379 people were killed, and about 1,200 more were wounded. After they ceased firing, the troops immediately withdrew from the place, leaving behind the dead and wounded.",

Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest (satyagraha) campaign, the noncooperation movement (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.",

Reaction in Britain to the massacre was mixed, however. Many condemned Dyer’s actions—including Sir Winston Churchill, then secretary of war, in a speech to the House of Commons in 1920—but the House of Lords praised Dyer and gave him a sword inscribed with the motto 'Saviour of the Punjab.' In addition, a large fund was raised by Dyer’s sympathizers and presented to him. The Jallianwala Bagh site in Amritsar is now a national monument.",

However, with the independence and the struggles associated with it beaming more and more historic or old; there is a growing fear that the youth of today are not able to understand the magnitude of what transpired before 1947. Moreover, there is a threat that if people are not reminded enough about India’s Republic Day, and the reasoning behind the celebration of it, people may soon forget their history and treat the day as yet another holiday. Therefore, it is in India’s best interest that Indians acknowledge the importance of the day and celebrate the independence that their forefathers dreamt of and fought for. That said, here are things that you might want to know and understand about India’s Republic Day and the traditions that govern it.",

This date was chosen as a day to commemorate the declaration of independence in 1930. India gained independence on 15th August 1947, but the laws of governance were based on the colonial Government of India Act 1935 in a modified way. The nation was a Dominion under Governor General Mountbatten and George VI as head of the state. India still did not have a permanent Constitution of its own. A draft of the Indian Constitution was presented by the Drafting Committee on 4th November 1947. The Assembly met consistently for over a period of 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days, discussing the matter until an agreed-upon version of the Constitution was finalized. On 24th January 1950, the Assembly signed two copies of the document in Hindi and English. The Constitution of India came into being on 26th January 1950 at 10:18 AM. This day has been known as the Republic Day of India since then. It is celebrated as a tribute to the declaration of the Constitution of India.",

The Executive is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws, comprising the President, the Prime Minister, the Council of Ministers, and state-level executives like Governors and Chief Ministers. The Legislature, consisting of the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) at the central level and state legislatures, is tasked with law-making and policy formulation. The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, ensures the interpretation and protection of the Constitution, safeguarding the rights of citizens and maintaining checks and balances. The Constitution defines the relationship between these bodies and the citizens, ensuring accountability and guiding national objectives such as Democracy, Socialism, Secularism, and National Integration. It provides a framework for governance while promoting equality, justice, and unity in diversity.",

The day begins in Delhi with the Prime Minister laying a wreath at the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate, paying tribute to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for India's independence, followed by a two-minute silence in their honor. The President of India presents bravery awards such as the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, Param Vir Chakra, Vir Chakra, and Maha Vir Chakra to armed forces and civilians, while children are honored with the National Bravery Awards. The President arrives at Rajpath, unfurls the national flag, and a 21-gun salute accompanies the national anthem. The celebrations conclude on 29th January with the ‘Beating Retreat’ ceremony at Vijay Chowk, where the bands of the armed forces perform, ending with the hymn ‘Abide with Me.’ Republic Day is a national holiday, celebrated across the country, with the main ceremonies broadcast live. Each year, a distinguished chief guest, often a head of state or government from another nation, is invited, reflecting India’s commitment to fostering global diplomatic relations.",
