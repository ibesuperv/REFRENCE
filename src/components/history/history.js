    description: 
      "The Partition of India was the division of British India into two independent dominions, India and Pakistan, on August 14-15, 1947. This division was based on religious lines, with Pakistan emerging as a Muslim-majority state and India as a secular state with a Hindu majority. The partition led to the largest forced migration in history, with approximately 14 million people displaced. The event was accompanied by unprecedented communal violence, mass killings, and social upheaval, leaving a lasting impact on both nations.",
