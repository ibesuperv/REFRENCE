    description: 
      "The Partition of India was the division of British India into two independent dominions, India and Pakistan, on August 14-15, 1947. This division was based on religious lines, with Pakistan emerging as a Muslim-majority state and India as a secular state with a Hindu majority. The partition led to the largest forced migration in history, with approximately 14 million people displaced. The event was accompanied by unprecedented communal violence, mass killings, and social upheaval, leaving a lasting impact on both nations.",
    background: [
      "British Colonial Rule: The British East India Company arrived in India in 1600 for trade but gradually established political dominance. Using the 'Divide and Rule' policy, they exploited religious, caste, and communal differences to consolidate power.",
      "Communal Divide: The British implemented policies that aggravated Hindu-Muslim divisions, such as the 1909 Morley-Minto Reforms and the 1932 Communal Award. Communal tensions escalated during the Khilafat Movement (1919-1924) and Hindu-Muslim riots in the 1920s and 1930s.",
      "Rise of Muslim League: The All-India Muslim League, founded in 1906, aimed to safeguard Muslim interests. By the 1940s, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the League demanded a separate Muslim state, leading to the Lahore Resolution of 1940.",
      "Nationalist Movements: The Indian National Congress (INC), led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, sought a unified India. However, they failed to address Muslim apprehensions, which strengthened communal demands.",
      "World War II and Quit India Movement: British weakening post-WWII and the Quit India Movement (1942) increased pressure to leave. Meanwhile, the British supported the Muslim League's demand for partition to counterbalance the INC's influence."
